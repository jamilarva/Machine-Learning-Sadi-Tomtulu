So, let's say you are learning how to make a histogram in R. For example, maybe you want to sample 100 numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 0, and standard deviation = 1, and then you want to plot a histogram. You can do this right here by using an r code block, like this:

```{r}
samples <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)
hist(samples)
```
